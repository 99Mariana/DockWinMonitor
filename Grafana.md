### Introduction

Managing software and complex systems is never simple, and unexpected issues are inevitable. **Observability** plays a key role in helping teams understand what is happening within a system, allowing them to identify, analyze, and resolve problems quickly. The three main pillars of observability are **metrics, logs, and traces**.

**Prometheus** focuses on the metrics pillar, collecting and storing time-series data about system performance. These metrics provide valuable insights, but they donâ€™t tell the full story. This is where **Grafana** adds significant value.

**Grafana** is a powerful open-source platform designed for **data visualization and monitoring**. It helps users track, analyze, interact with, and understand data from multiple sources through dynamic, real-time dashboards. The platform can connect to numerous data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Loki, and others. Users can also configure alerting rules to notify teams when certain thresholds are exceeded.

Together, Grafana and Prometheus form a robust observability stack. Grafana serves as a visualization and analysis layer on top of Prometheus, transforming raw numerical data into clear, interactive dashboards. These dashboards enable teams to easily monitor system health, detect trends, and understand system behavior at a glance.
