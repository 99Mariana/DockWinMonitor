Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It helps you collect and analyze metrics from various systems and applications to understand their performance and health.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, meaning each metric is recorded along with the timestamp of when it was captured. Additionally, metrics can include **labels**â€”optional key-value pairs that provide more context, such as the source, service, or instance of the data.

In simple terms, Prometheus lets you track how systems behave over time and trigger alerts when something goes wrong, making it a powerful tool for monitoring modern infrastructure.

#### Architecture

As shown on the official website, the architecture of Prometheus and some of its ecosystem components is illustrated below:

In this image, we can see the Prometheus server, which is responsible for scraping and storing time series data. It also shows the client libraries used to instrument application code, the Pushgateway that supports short-lived jobs, and various exporters designed for specific services such as HAProxy, StatsD, and Graphite. Additionally, it includes the Alertmanager, which manages alerts, and several supporting tools.

These components work together to form the Prometheus ecosystem: the server continuously collects metrics from different sources, the exporters expose metrics from third-party systems, and the Alertmanager handles notifications based on alerting rules. This architecture enables Prometheus to provide a flexible, reliable, and scalable monitoring solution for dynamic and distributed environments.
