Grafana is a powerful open-source platform designed for data visualization and monitoring. It helps users track, analyze, and understand data from multiple sources through dynamic and real-time dashboards. Originally focused on time-series metrics, Grafana has grown into a complete observability tool widely used across DevOps, IT, and data analysis environments.

The platform can connect to numerous data sources such as Prometheus, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Loki, among others. Grafana makes it easy to visualize data with interactive charts, graphs, tables, and heatmaps. Users can also set up alerting rules to notify teams when certain thresholds are exceeded.
