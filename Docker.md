### What is Docker?
> [Docker](#Docker) > [Content](#content) > [This section](#introduction)

Docker is a virtualization software that helps developers create, run, and manage applications more easily. It works by packaging application in a container with all necessary dependencies, configurations, system tools and runtime. Containers are lightweight and can run on any computer in the same way, which prevents problems that happen when an application works on one machine but not another. 

It also makes it easier to share applications with other developers or teams, because the container includes everything needed to run the application correctly. Docker standardizes how services are run in local development environments, removing the need for developers to manually install and configure all dependencies on their own machines. Using Docker, developers can quickly deploy applications, update them without breaking other parts of the system, and run multiple applications on the same computer without conflicts. Addicionaly docker allow developers to have different versions of the same app without any conflicts.
